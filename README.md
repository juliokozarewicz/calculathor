# Calculathor

The Calculathor is a project developed specifically to enhance my portfolio as a developer. Using React Native, this application features a basic operations calculator, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. Additionally, it includes a handy function to clear the screen, allowing users to correct any typing errors and maintain accuracy in their calculations. The Calculathor not only showcases my skills in mobile app development but also provides a practical and functional tool to meet users' daily needs.
